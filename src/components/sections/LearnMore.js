                  Despite anti-theft innovations, card fraud continues. The
                  majority of all theft happens at the local or merchant level.
                  Improper handling and storage of your card information is the
                  biggest reason. These days it is all too easy for an employee
                  to take a picture of your card or even swipe it on their phone
                  before returning it to you.

                  Companies spend billions on network security, yet breaches
                  continue. In a typical card transaction, there are dozens of
                  opportunities where your card data can be intercepted by
                  outsiders. Yet sadly, a large percentage of data breaches
                  originate from within the organization itself, which is nearly
                  impossible to guard against completely. In the end, the only
                  way to completely ensure your card data is not compromised is
                  to not send it flying across the internet in the first place.
